# cluster-based-analysis-for-fall-detection
•	Designed and developed a clustering based method to detect falls using Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM ) using a comprehensive 13-feature set\
•	Extracted 8 features from the acceleration readings and 5 features from the ppg readings after converting it from analog to digital signals from a temporary sliding window of size 6 seconds and 90% overlap\
•	The model was trained only on non-fall samples and tested on both fall and non-fall data. Falls were detected as anomalies
